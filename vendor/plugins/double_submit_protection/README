= Double Submit Protection Plugin =
===================================

This plugin implements a symetrical token approach to avoid duplicate posts of data. This is specially
useful when you're dealing with data-sensitive forms (credit-card processing, for instance), where
a duplicated posting may lead to a user getting charged twice. This control is done via a
token placed on user's form and synchronized with the session - whenever the token is different, you
can simply verify it on the controllers by using the 'double_submit?' method

Version History
===============

v1.0 <-- You are here
- Initial release of the plugin

v1.1 (still to be released)
- Automatic support for token as an attribute (e.g. form_for :something, :url => {}, :double_submit_protection => true }
- Save the cheerleader, save the world

Usage Example
=============

some_view.html.erb
----------------------------------------------------------------------
<%= form_for :blah, :url => { :action => "create" } do |f| %>
  ... (some form content here)
  <%=double_submit_token %>
<% end %>
----------------------------------------------------------------------

blah_controller.rb
  def create
    if double_submit?
      flash[:message] = 'Whoa, hang in there dude...'
      render :action => :register
      return
    end

    # do something here
  end
end
